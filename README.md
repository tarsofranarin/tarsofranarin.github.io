## Human Activity Recognition

In this [project](https://github.com/tarsofranarin/tarsofranarin.github.io/blob/master/HAR.ipynb) I use accelerometer data from mobile phones to recognise different daily activities. Various machine learning models such as random forest classifiers and convolutional neural networks are deployed.
